## What are Data Structures ?
=> Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming. They define how data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a program. Understanding data structures is very important for developing efficient and effective algorithms. A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed.

## Types of Data Structures :

=> Physical Data Structures :
1. Arrays: Arrays can be created either in a stack or heap memory.
2. Linked Lists: Linked Lists can only be created in the heap memory.

=> Logical Data Structures :
Linear Data Structures:
1. Stack : LIFO (Last In First Out)
2. Queues : FIFO (First In First Out)

Non-Linear Data Structures :
3. Trees :
4. Graph :

Linear/Tabular Data Structure :
5. Hash Table :

Note : Logical Data Structure can only be implemented using Physical Data Structures i.e. either by Array or Linked Lists or the combination of both.
